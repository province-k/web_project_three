# Project 3: From Portland to Portland

### Overview
This is my second real project. The website about traveling across the US.

**Technologies**

HTML

CSS

**Description**

I used all the information I have learned over the past few weeks to create this project. I followed a spec sheet on Figma. I had to make it responsive for most popular resolutions. There are a few hover affects. I used BEM methodology and file structure.

**Improvements and status**

I plan to continue to perfect this project. Fine tuning its responsive nature and adding media queries for higher resolutions. 

Status: in progress
